# adl-support

A Clojure library designed to support auto-generated [ADL](https://git.journeyman.cc/simon/adl) code. This library should normally be included into projects generated by ADL, and consequently is licenced under the MIT license, which is less restrictive than the GNU General Public License which I normally use.

## Usage

You don't really use this; code auto-generated by ADL does. Some functions which may be more generally useful are in `adl-support.core`, q.v.

## Note: GitHub

This project was hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/simon-brooke/adl-support. In accordance with journeyman policy the canonical repository is now [https://git.journeyman.cc/simon/adl-support](https://git.journeyman.cc/simon/adl-support). While the GitHub repository still exists it is no longer maintained and will in due course be colled.

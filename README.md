# adl-support

A Clojure library designed to support auto-generated [ADL](https://github.com/simon-brooke/adl) code. This library should normally be included into projects generated by ADL, and consequently is licenced under the MIT license, which is less restrictive than the GNU General Public License which I normally use.

## Usage

You don't really use this; code auto-generated by ADL does.

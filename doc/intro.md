# Introduction to adl-support

`adl-support` is a small library of functions used by the [Application
Description Language](https://github.com/simon-brooke/adl) system to generate
elements of a Clojure web-app, which may be useful to people writing web-apps
either based on Application Description Language or otherwise.
